  # Due to Rack's popularity within the Ruby community, OpenTracing-Ruby
  # provides a Rack-specific format for injection into and extraction from HTTP
  # headers specifically, though there are some strings attached.

  # The carrier for FORMAT_RACK should be `env` or equivalent. It behaves like
  # FORMAT_TEXT_MAP, but with all keys transformed per Rack's treatment of HTTP
  # headers. Keep in mind that Rack automatically uppercases all headers and
  # replaces dashes with underscores. This means that if you use dashes and
  # underscores and case-sensitive baggage keys, they may collide or become
  # unrecognizable.

  #   x-b3-sampled
